## Overview

![screenshot](screencapture-localhost-3000-2021-09-24-15_16_44.png)

I made this DevChallenge to learn more about React. It was a fun little project and I feel that I learned a lot about React basics! There would be many things to refactor still, but at this point it's good enough for me. :)
